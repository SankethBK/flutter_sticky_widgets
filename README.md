With flutter_sticky_widgets you can use a widget as if it is `position: sticky;` in CSS. 

Sticky widgets is an UI pattern where we want widgets to scroll along with the UI upto a certain point, and then stick to the screen instead of scrolling off the screen.

_(Green play button in first image, and shuffle play button in second image are examples for position: sticky)_
